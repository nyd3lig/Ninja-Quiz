<h1>Ninja Quiz</h1>
<p>
So this is a ninja quiz made from the udemy course Modern Javascript(Complete guide, from Novice to Ninja)
</p>

<p>
I haven't added any flair to it, but overall I found the setInterval() method introduced pretty interesting, and interesting how much a simple animation of a number can add to the user experience of a page. Overall the HTML was made with bootstrap, and since that is not the focus of this course, the html is completely copied.

<p>
The scrollTo() method was also neat, and another little flair. apart from that just simple DOM manipulation using querySelectors and event listeners.

Will be making my own quiz from scratch to really drill what I've learnt.
